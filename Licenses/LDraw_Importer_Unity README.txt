Example of work: https://habr.com/post/433364/

To open the plugin select - Window -> LDrawImporter -> Open Importer

The plugin has two modes: ByName and Models

ByName - generates any part or model by its name (write without extension)

Models - displays a list of models that lie along the path LDrawFiles / blueprints / models / (models can be found here omr.ldraw.org)

By clicking on the Generate button , the selected model will be generated in the selected scene. If Generate gives an error and does not generate the model, try clicking Update bluepritns or follow the instructions from the error.

Update bluepritns - updates available blueprints if you put new ones in the folder with ldraw files
